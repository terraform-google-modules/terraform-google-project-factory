# Google Cloud Project Factory Terraform Module

[FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md) | [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) |
[Glossary][glossary].

This module allows you to create opinionated Google Cloud Platform projects. It
creates projects and configures aspects like Shared VPC connectivity, IAM
access, Service Accounts, and API enablement to follow best practices.

To include G Suite integration for creating groups and adding Service Accounts into groups, use the
[gsuite_enabled module][gsuite-enabled-module].

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.13+ and tested using Terraform 1.0+. If you find incompatibilities using Terraform >=0.13, please open an issue.
 If you haven't
[upgraded][terraform-0.13-upgrade] and need a Terraform
0.12.x-compatible version of this module, the last released version
intended for Terraform 0.12.x is [9.2.0].

## Upgrading

See the [docs](./docs) for detailed instructions on upgrading between major releases of the module.

## Usage

There are multiple examples included in the [examples](./examples/) folder but simple usage is as follows:

```hcl
module "project-factory" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/project-factory/google"
  version = "~> 14.4"

  name                 = "pf-test-1"
  random_project_id    = true
  org_id               = "1234567890"
  usage_bucket_name    = "pf-test-1-usage-report-bucket"
  usage_bucket_prefix  = "pf/test/1/integration"
  billing_account      = "ABCDEF-ABCDEF-ABCDEF"
  svpc_host_project_id = "shared_vpc_host_name"

  shared_vpc_subnets = [
    "projects/base-project-196723/regions/us-east1/subnetworks/default",
    "projects/base-project-196723/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/default",
    "projects/base-project-196723/regions/us-central1/subnetworks/subnet-1",
  ]
}
```

## Features

The Project Factory module will take the following actions:

1. Create a new GCP project using the `project_name`.
1. If a shared VPC is specified, attach the new project to the
   `svpc_host_project_id`.

   It will also give the following users network access on the specified subnets:

   - The project's new default service account (see step 4)
   - The Google API service account for the project
   - The project controlling group specified in `group_name`

1. Delete the default compute service account.
1. Create a new default service account for the project.
    1. Give it access to the shared VPC
       (to be able to launch instances).
1. Attach the billing account (`billing_account`) to the project.
1. Give the controlling group access to the project, with the `group_role`.
1. Enable the required and specified APIs (`activate_apis`).
1. Delete the default network.
1. Enable usage report for GCE into central project bucket
   (`target_usage_bucket`), if provided.
1. If specified, create the GCS bucket `bucket_name` and give the
   following accounts Storage Admin on it:
   1. The controlling group (`group_name`).
   1. The new default compute service account created for the project.
   1. The Google APIs service account for the project.

The roles granted are specifically:

- New Default Service Account
  - `compute.networkUser` on host project or specified subnets
  - `storage.admin` on `bucket_name` GCS bucket
- `group_name` is the controlling group
  - `compute.networkUser` on host project or specific subnets
  - Specified `group_role` on project
  - `iam.serviceAccountUser` on the default Service Account
  - `storage.admin` on `bucket_name` GCS bucket
- Google APIs Service Account
  - `compute.networkUser` on host project or specified subnets
  - `storage.admin` on `bucket_name` GCS bucket

### Shared VPC subnets and IAM permissions

A service project's access to shared VPC networks is controlled via the
`roles/compute.networkUser` role and the location to where that role is
assigned. If that role is assigned to the shared VPC host project, then the
service project will have access to **all** shared VPC subnetworks. If that role
is assigned to individual subnetworks, then the service project will have
access to only the subnetworks on which that role was assigned. The logic for
determining that location is as follows:

1. If `var.svpc_host_project_id` and `var.shared_vpc_subnets` are not set then the `compute.networkUser` role is not assigned
1. If `var.svpc_host_project_id` is set but no subnetworks are provided via `var.shared_vpc_subnets` then the `compute.networkUser` role is assigned at the host project and the service project will have access to all shared VPC subnetworks
1. If `var.svpc_host_project_id` is set and `var.shared_vpc_subnets` contains an array of subnetworks then the `compute.networkUser` role is assigned to each subnetwork in the array

### Permissions

In order to execute this module you must have a Service Account with the
following roles:

- `roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer` on the folder that you want to create the
  project in
- `roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer` on the organization
- `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` on the organization
- `roles/billing.user` on the organization
- `roles/storage.admin` on bucket_project
- If you are using shared VPC:
  - `roles/billing.user` on the organization
  - `roles/compute.xpnAdmin` on the organization
  - `roles/compute.networkAdmin` on the organization
  - `roles/browser` on the Shared VPC host project
  - `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin` on the Shared VPC host project

#### Script Helper

A [helper script](./helpers/setup-sa.sh) is included to create the Seed Service
Account in the [Seed Project](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory/blob/master/docs/GLOSSARY.md#seed-project),
grant the necessary roles to the [Seed Service Account](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory/blob/master/docs/GLOSSARY.md#seed-service-account),
and enable the necessary API's in the Seed Project.  Run it as follows:

```sh
./helpers/setup-sa.sh -o <organization id> -p <project id> [-b <billing account id>] [-f <folder id>] [-n <service account name>]
```

In order to execute this script, you must have an account with the following list of
permissions:

- `resourcemanager.organizations.list`
- `resourcemanager.projects.list`
- `billing.accounts.list`
- `iam.serviceAccounts.create`
- `iam.serviceAccountKeys.create`
- `resourcemanager.organizations.setIamPolicy`
- `resourcemanager.projects.setIamPolicy`
- `serviceusage.services.enable` on the project
- `servicemanagement.services.bind` on following services:
  - cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com
  - cloudbilling.googleapis.com
  - iam.googleapis.com
  - admin.googleapis.com
  - appengine.googleapis.com
- `billing.accounts.getIamPolicy` on a billing account.
- `billing.accounts.setIamPolicy` on a billing account.

#### Specifying credentials

The Project Factory module uses the [Google Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/provider_reference#authentication)
to authenticate all GCP API calls.
To configure credentials, you should configure the `google` and `google-beta` providers.

```terraform
provider "google" {
  credentials = "${file(var.credentials_path)}"
}

provider "google-beta" {
  credentials = "${file(var.credentials_path)}"
}
```

### APIs

In order to operate the Project Factory, you must activate the following APIs on
the base project where the Service Account was created:

- Cloud Resource Manager API - `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`
  [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#missing-api-cloudresourcemanagergoogleapiscom)
- Cloud Billing API - `cloudbilling.googleapis.com`
  [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#missing-api-cloudbillinggoogleapiscom)
- Identity and Access Management API - `iam.googleapis.com`
  [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#missing-api-iamgoogleapiscom)
- Admin SDK - `admin.googleapis.com`
  [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#missing-api-admingoogleapiscom)

#### Optional APIs

- Google App Engine Admin API - `appengine.googleapis.com`
  [troubleshooting](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#missing-api-appenginegoogleapiscom)
  - Please note that if you are deploying an App Engine Flex application, you should not delete the default compute service account
    (as is default behavior). Please see the [troubleshooting doc](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md#cannot-deploy-app-engine-flex-application) for more information.
- Cloud Billing Budget API - `billingbudgets.googleapis.com`
  - Please note this API is only required if configuring budgets for projects.

### Verifying setup

A [preconditions checker script][preconditions-checker-script] is
included to verify that all preconditions are met before the Project Factory
runs. The script will run automatically if the script dependencies (Python,
"google-auth", and "google-api-python-client") are available at runtime. If the
dependencies are not met, the precondition checking step will be skipped.

The precondition checker script can be directly invoked before running the
project factory:

```sh
./helpers/preconditions/preconditions.py \
  --credentials_path "./credentials.json" \
  --billing_account 000000-000000-000000 \
  --org_id 000000000000 \
  --folder_id 000000000000 \
  --shared_vpc 'shared-vpc-host-ed64'
```

## Caveats

### Moving projects from org into a folder

There is currently a bug with moving a project which was originally created at
the root of the organization into a folder. The bug and workaround is described
[here](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-google/issues/1701),
but as a general best practice it is easier to create all projects within
folders to start. Moving projects between different folders *is* supported.

### Deleting default service accounts

[Default SAs](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#default) can be removed by setting `default_service_account` input variable to `delete`, but there can be certain scenarios where the default SAs are required. Hence some considerations to be aware of:
1. [Using App Engine SA](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/default-service-account).
1. Cloud Scheduler dependency on AppEngine(default SA). Default SA is required to be able to setup [Cloud scheduler](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/setup#use_gcloud_to_create_a_project_with_an_app_engine_app), please refer to the [document](https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/setup#use_gcloud_to_create_a_project_with_an_app_engine_app) for more upto date information.

With a combination of project-factory's default behavior, [disable](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory/blob/master/variables.tf#L202-L206), and setting [constraints/iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints) org constraint will address removing the default editor IAM role on the SAs and limits the SA usage. However, when the `default_service_account` is set to `delete` please be aware of the default SA dependency for AppEngine/CloudScheduler services. Accounts deleted within 30days can be [restored](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#undeleting).

## G Suite

The core Project Factory solely deals with GCP APIs and does not integrate G Suite functionality. If you would like certain group-management functionality which was previously included in the Project Factory, see the [G Suite module][gsuite-enabled-module].
