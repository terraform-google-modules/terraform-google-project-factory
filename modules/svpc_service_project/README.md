# Shared VPC
This module performs the same functions as the root module with the addition of assigning the project as a Shared VPC service project associated with a given host project and granting IAM permissions on host project and subnets to appropriate API service accounts based on activated APIs.

The advantage of using this module over the root module, is being able to provision both the host project and service projects within a single configuration. See [examples/shared_vpc](../../examples/shared_vpc) for a full example.

## Example Usage
```hcl
module "service-project" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/project-factory/google//modules/svpc_service_project"
  version = "~> 14.4"

  name                = "pf-test-1"
  random_project_id   = true
  org_id              = "1234567890"
  usage_bucket_name   = "pf-test-1-usage-report-bucket"
  usage_bucket_prefix = "pf/test/1/integration"
  billing_account     = "ABCDEF-ABCDEF-ABCDEF"
  shared_vpc          = module.host-project.project_id

  activate_apis = [
    "compute.googleapis.com",
    "container.googleapis.com",
    "dataproc.googleapis.com",
    "dataflow.googleapis.com",
  ]
}
```
