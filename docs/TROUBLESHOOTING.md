# Troubleshooting

## Terminology

* **seed project**: An existing GCP project with resources, services, and service accounts needed to create projects with the project factory.
* **service account**: The service account (which exists in the **seed project**) that creates the **target project**.
* **target project**: The project being generated by the Project Factory.

## Problems

* [Common issues](#common-issues)
* [Seed project missing APIs](#seed-project-missing-apis) - The seed project is missing required APIs.
* [Service account missing roles](#service-account-missing-roles) - The service account has insufficient permissions.

### Common issues

* [Unable to query status of default GCE service account](#unable-to-query-status-of-default-gce-service-account)
* [Cannot manage G Suite group membership](#cannot-manage-g-suite-group-membership)

#### Unable to query status of default GCE service account

When the Project Factory is used with a misconfigured seed project, it partially generate a new project, fail, and get into a state where it can no longer generate plans.

**Error message:**

```
Error: Error refreshing state: 1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.data.google_compute_default_service_account.default: 1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.data.google_compute_default_service_account.default: data.google_compute_default_service_account.default: Error reading GCE service account not found: googleapi: Error 403: Project 449949713944 is not found and cannot be used for API calls. If it is recently created, enable Compute Engine API by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute.googleapis.com/overview?project=449949713944 then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry., accessNotConfigured
```

**Cause:**

The Project Factory has generated a new project but couldn't enable the `compute.googleapis.com` API. This causes Terraform to get jammed, with the following causal chain:

1. `terraform plan` tries to query the default GCE service account.
1. The query fails because the `compute.googleapis.com` API is not enabled on the target project.
1. The `compute.googleapis.com` API is not enabled on the target project because it does not have an associated billing account.
1. The target project does not have an associated billing account for one of the following causes:
    * The seed project does not have the `cloudbilling.googleapis.com` API enabled, so Terraform cannot enable billing on the target project.
    * The service account does not have the `roles/billing.user` role on the associated billing account, and cannot link the target project with the billing account.

This issue is confusing because the error indicates that the `compute.googleapis.com` API is disabled on the target project, but the absence of the Google Compute Engine API is a symptom of an issue with configuring billing, rather than the cause of the issue itself.

**Solution:**

In order to recover the Terraform configuration, the required APIs need to be enabled on the seed project and target project.

1. Enable billing on the seed project:
    1. Enable the `cloudbilling.googleapis.com` API on the seed project:
        ```
        # Requires `roles/serviceusage.admin` on $SEED_PROJECT
        gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com --project "$SEED_PROJECT"
        ```
    1. Associate a billing account with the seed project:
        ```
        # Requires `roles/billing.projectManager` on $SEED_PROJECT and `roles/billing.user` on the billing account
        gcloud alpha billing projects link "$SEED_PROJECT" --billing-account=[billing-account]
        ```
1. Enable `compute.googleapis.com` on the target project:
    ```
    # Requires `roles/serviceusage.admin` on $TARGET_PROJECT
    gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com --project $TARGET_PROJECT
    ```

#### Cannot manage G Suite group membership

**Error message:**

```
Error: Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.gsuite_group_member.service_account_sa_group_member: 1 error(s) occurred:

* gsuite_group_member.service_account_sa_group_member: Error creating group member: Post https://www.googleapis.com/admin/directory/v1/groups/thebo-pf-service-accounts/members?alt=json: oauth2: cannot fetch token: 401 Unauthorized
Response: {
 "error" : "unauthorized_client",
 "error_description" : "Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method."
}
```

**Cause:**

By default service accounts cannot manage G Suite resources, because the G Suite directory API requires a user account with admin rights. A service account can impersonate a user account with admin rights to interact with the directory API, but the service account has to be granted domain wide delegation rights to impersonate users, and must be granted OAuth scopes for the functionality it needs to interact with.

If domain wide delegation on the appropriate is not granted to the service account, it will fail to get the access token needed to interact with the Directory API and fail.

See the [README G Suite documentation](../README.md#g-suite) for more information.

**Solution:**

Enable [domain wide delegation](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation) on the service account with the following scopes:

* https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group
* https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.member

### Seed project missing APIs

The Project Factory requires the following services are enabled on the seed project. If these APIs are not enabled the Project may fail to generate resources, or generate incomplete resources.

A canonical list of required APIs is available in the [README](../README.md#apis).

* [cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com](#missing-api-cloudresourcemanagergoogleapiscom)
* [cloudbilling.googleapis.com](#missing-api-cloudbillinggoogleapiscom)
* [iam.googleapis.com](#missing-api-iamgoogleapiscom)
* [appengine.googleapis.com](#missing-appenginegoogleapiscom) (when managing an App Engine instance on the target project)
* [admin.googleapis.com](#missing-admingoogleapiscom) (when managing G Suite groups and group membership)

#### Missing API: `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`

**Error message:**

```
Error: Error refreshing state: 1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.data.google_organization.org: 1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.data.google_organization.org: data.google_organization.org: Error reading Organization Not Found : [organization-id]: googleapi: Error 403: Cloud Resource Manager API has not been used in project [seed-project-number] before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/overview?project=[seed-project-number] then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry., accessNotConfigured

```

**Cause:**

The seed project does not have the `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com` API enabled. This prevents the Project Factory from looking up the GCP organization.

**Solution:**

* **Option 1:** enable the required API with `gcloud`:
    ```
    # Requires `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    gcloud services enable cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com --project "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```
* **Option 2:** create a new service account and enable the required APIs:
    ```
    # requires `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` on the organization and `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    ./helpers/setup-sa.sh [organization id] "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```

#### Missing API: `cloudbilling.googleapis.com`

**Error message:**

```
Error: Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.google_project.project: 1 error(s) occurred:

* google_project.project: Error setting billing account "[billing-account]" for project "projects/[target-project-id]": googleapi: Error 403: Cloud Billing API has not been used in project [seed-project-number] before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/cloudbilling.googleapis.com/overview?project=[seed-project-number] then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry., accessNotConfigured
```

**Cause:**

The seed project does not have the `cloudbilling.googleapis.com` API enabled. This prevents the Project Factory from enabling APIs that may result in billing charges, such as the Google Compute Engine API.

**Solution:**

* **Option 1:** enable the required API with `gcloud`:
    ```
    # Requires `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    $ gcloud services enable cloudbilling.googleapis.com --project "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```
* **Option 2:** create a new service account and enable the required APIs:
    ```
    # requires `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` on the organization and `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    ./helpers/setup-sa.sh [organization id] "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```

**Notes:**

This error will occur *once* when applying a Terraform plan when the **seed project** does not have the Cloud Billing API enabled. On subsequent Terraform runs, Terraform will generate an error indicating that the Compute Engine API is not enabled on the **target project**. Watch out for this!

#### Missing API: `iam.googleapis.com`

**Error message:**
```
Error: Error applying plan:

```

**Cause:**

The seed project does not have the `iam.googleapis.com` API enabled. This prevents the Project Factory from deleting the default GCE service account and assigning IAM roles to groups, service accounts, etc.

**Solution:**

* **Option 1:** enable the required API with `gcloud`:
    ```
    # Requires `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com --project "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```
* **Option 2:** create a new service account and enable the required APIs:
    ```
    # requires `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` on the organization and `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    ./helpers/setup-sa.sh [organization id] "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```

#### Missing API: `appengine.googleapis.com`

```

**Cause**:

The App Engine API is not enabled on the seed project, which prevents creation of an App Engine instance on the target project.

**Solution:**

* **Option 1:** enable the required API with `gcloud`:
    ```
    # Requires `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    gcloud services enable appengine.googleapis.com --project "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```
* **Option 2:** create a new service account and enable the required APIs:
    ```
    # requires `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` on the organization and `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    ./helpers/setup-sa.sh [organization id] "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```

**Notes:**

The absence of the `appengine.googleapis.com` API will not cause Terraform to fail, but any interactions with the App Engine instance will fail. Once this API is activated, it might take a few minutes for Terraform to detect that the App Engine instance is not present and then create it.

#### Missing API: `admin.googleapis.com`

**Error message:**

```
Error: Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.gsuite_group_member.service_account_sa_group_member: 1 error(s) occurred:

* gsuite_group_member.service_account_sa_group_member: Error creating group member: googleapi: Error 403: Access Not Configured.

If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry., accessNotConfigured
```

**Cause:**

The Directory Admin API is not enabled on the seed project, which prevents management of G Suite resources.

See the [README G Suite documentation](../README.md#g-suite) for more information.

**Solution:**

* **Option 1:** enable the required API with `gcloud`:
    ```
    # Requires `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    gcloud services enable admin.googleapis.com --project "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```
* **Option 2:** create a new service account and enable the required APIs:
    ```
    # requires `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` on the organization and `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` on $SEED_PROJECT
    ./helpers/setup-sa.sh [organization id] "$SEED_PROJECT"
    ```

### Service account missing roles

The service account must have the following roles in order to fully create a project factory.

A canonical list of required roles is available in the [README](../README.md#permissions)

* Organizational roles
    * [roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer](#missing-org-role-rolesresourcemanagerorganizationviewer) - Required for looking up the domain name associated with the GCP organization ID.
    * [roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator](#missing-org-role-rolesresourcemanagerprojectcreator) - Required for creating GCP projects within the organization.
    * [roles/compute.xpnAdmin](#missing-shared-vpc-roles) (when using a shared VPC) - Required for associating the target project with the host VPC.
    * [roles/compute.networkAdmin](#missing-shared-vpc-roles) (when using a shared VPC) - Required for managing shared VPC subnetwork IAM policies.
* Shared VPC project roles (when using a shared VPC)
    * [roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin](#missing-shared-vpc-roles) - Required for managing shared VPC project IAM policies.
    * [roles/browser](#missing-shared-vpc-roles) - Required for enumerating shared VPC resources.
* Billing account roles
    * [roles/billing.user](#missing-roles-billinguserrole) - Required for associating the billing account with a project.

#### Missing org role: `roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer`

**Error message:**

```
* module.project-factory.data.google_organization.org: 1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.data.google_organization.org: data.google_organization.org: Error reading Organization Not Found : [organization-id]: googleapi: Error 403: The caller does not have permission, forbidden
```

**Cause:**

The active service account does not have `roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer` on the active organization. The organizationViewer role grants the service account the ability to look up the GCP organization by the organization ID and fetch the associated domain name.

**Solution:**

Use `helpers/setup-sa.sh` to create a new service account with the necessary roles.

OR

```
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding \
  "${ORG_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SA_ID}" \
  --role="roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer" \
  --user-output-enabled false
```

#### Missing org role: `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`

**Error message:**

```

* module.project-factory.google_project.project: 1 error(s) occurred:

* google_project.project: error creating project [target-project-id] ([target-project-name]): googleapi: Error 403: User is not authorized., forbidden. If you received a 403 error, make sure you have the `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` permission
```

**Cause:**

The active service account does not have `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` on the active organization. The projectCreator role allows the service account to generate new projects within the GCP organization.

**Solution:**

Use `helpers/setup-sa.sh` to create a new service account with the necessary roles.

OR

```
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding \
  "${ORG_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SA_ID}" \
  --role="roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator" \
  --user-output-enabled false
```

#### Missing Shared VPC roles

* google_project_iam_member.controlling_group_vpc_membership.2: Error retrieving IAM policy for project "[shared-vpc-project-id]": googleapi: Error 403: The caller does not have permission, forbidden
```

**Cause:**

The service account is missing one of the following roles:

* Organization
    * `roles/compute.xpnAdmin`
    * `roles/compute.networkAdmin`
    * `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`
* Shared VPC
    * `roles/browser`
    * `roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin`

These roles are required for associating the target project with the host VPC and managing access to the host VPC network resources.

**Solution:**

Use `helpers/setup-sa.sh` to create a new service account with the necessary roles.

OR

```sh
# Requires `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` on $ORG_ID
gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding \
  "${ORG_ID}" \
  --member="serviceAccount:${SA_ID}" \
  --role="roles/compute.xpnAdmin" \

#### Missing `roles/billing.user` role

**Error message:**
```
Error: Error applying plan:

1 error(s) occurred:

* module.project-factory.google_project.project: 1 error(s) occurred:

* google_project.project: Error setting billing account "[billing-account]" for project "projects/[target-project-id]": googleapi: Error 403: The caller does not have permission, forbidden
```

**Cause**:

The service account does not have the `roles/billing.user` role on the billing account, and cannot link projects to the billing account. This will prevent activation of GCP APIs (such as the Compute Engine API) that may incur billing charges.

**Solution:**

Add the service account to the `roles/billing.user` role on the billing account.

1. Fetch the billing account IAM policy.
    ```
    # Requires `roles/billing.admin` on the billing account
    $ gcloud beta billing accounts get-iam-policy [billing-account] | tee policy.yml
    bindings:
    - members:
      - group:devs@example.com
      role: roles/billing.admin
    - members:
      - group:billing-users@example.com
      - serviceAccount:[service-account]@[seed-project-id].iam.gserviceaccount.com
      role: roles/billing.user
    etag: BwV3v6LFTjQ=
    ```
1. Update the policy to include the service account.
    ```
    $ $EDITOR policy.yml
    ```
1. Verify that the policy is correct and only affects the service account.
    ```
    $ cat policy.yml
    bindings:
    - members:
      - group:devs@example.com
      role: roles/billing.admin
    - members:
      - group:billing-users@example.com
      - serviceAccount:[service-account]@[seed-project-id].iam.gserviceaccount.com
      role: roles/billing.user
    etag: BwV3v6LFTjQ=
    ```
1. Update the billing account policy.
    ```
    # Requires `roles/billing.admin` on the billing account
    $ gcloud beta billing accounts set-iam-policy [billing-account] policy.yml
    Updated IAM policy for account [[billing-account]].
    ```

**Notes:**

Granting `roles/billing.user` on the organization is not sufficient if the billing account is defined outside of the GCP organization. Make sure that the service account has the `roles/billing.user` role on the billing account.
