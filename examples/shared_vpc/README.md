# Shared VPC Host Project

This example illustrates how to create a [Shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) host project.

It includes creating the host project and using the [network module](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-network) to create network.

It then attaches two new service projects to the host project.
