# Simple project with GKE shared VPC

This illustrates how to create a project with a shared VPC from a host project that is GKE suitable.

As shown in this exmaple, GKE shared VPC is only enabled if the "container.googleapis.com" API is in the "activate_apis" variable list.

It will do the following:

- Create a project
- Give appropriate iam permissions to the API and GKE service accounts on the host vpc project

Expected variables:

- `org_id`
- `billing_account`
- `shared_vpc`

To specify a subnet use the "shared_vpc_subnets" variable, and list subnets like the following:

- ["projects/<my-project-id>/regions/<my-region>/subnetworks/<subnet-one-id>", "projects/<my-project-id>/regions/<my-region>/subnetworks/<subnet-two-id>"]

If no subnets are specified, all networks and subnets from the host project are shared.
